# Instructions for Assignment

This directory contains a Node.js app, and you need to get it running in a container.

Edit the Dockerfile in this directory.

## Overview of this assignment

- Use the instructions below and interpret them into what the Dockerfile should contain.I
- Once the Dockerfile builds correctly, start container locally to make sure it works on [http://localhost](http://localhost)
- Then ensure the image is named properly for your Docker Hub account with a new repository name
- Then push to Docker Hub, and go to [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com) to verify you pushed it correctly
- Then remove local image from cache (`docker image rm <name>`)
- Then start a new container from your Hub image, and watch how it auto downloads and runs
- Test again that it works at [http://localhost](http://localhost)

## Instructions from the app developer

- you should use the `node` official image, with the alpine 6.x branch (`node:6-alpine`)
- This app listens on port 3000, but the container should listen on port 80 of the Docker host, so it will respond to [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80) on your computer
- Then it should use the alpine package manager to install tini: `apk add --no-cache tini`.
- Then it should create directory /usr/src/app for app files with `mkdir -p /usr/src/app`, or with the Dockerfile command `WORKDIR /usr/src/app`.
- Node.js uses a "package manager", so it needs to copy in package.json file.
- Then it needs to run 'npm install' to install dependencies from that file.
- To keep it clean and small, run `npm cache clean --force` after the above, in the same RUN command.
- Then it needs to copy in all files from current directory into the image.
- Then it needs to start the container with the command `/sbin/tini -- node ./bin/www`. Be sure to use JSON array syntax for CMD. (`CMD [ "something", "something" ]`)
- In the end you should be using FROM, RUN, WORKDIR, COPY, EXPOSE, and CMD co
